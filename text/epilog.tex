With the help of deep neural network features and clustering, we created an image dataset of commonly occurring objects. We then used the dataset to retrain a neural network and build powerful, easy-to-use query interface. We created artificial users to accurately approximate the capabilities of our model, fine-tune its parameters and to select the best retrieval strategies. We also discussed our successful participation at Video Browse Showdown 2018 which we won by a~significant margin.

All in all, we showed that a retrained neural network on our set of carefully selected labels and powerful query formulation interface together with color sketches and semantic browsing based on features from neural networks could beat other state-of-the-art retrieval tools.


In future, we would like to focus on extending the text labeling beyond a fixed set of labels using multimodal approaches of deep learning.
